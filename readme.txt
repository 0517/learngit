Git is a distributed version control system.
Git is free software distributed under GPL.
Git has a mutable index called stage.
Git tracks changes.
Creating a new branch is quick.

Checkout branch from remote doesn't set the relationship with that remote branch.
Therefore, when push or pull, you have to specify the full [repository] [repository]/[branch].
Or you can --set-upstream=origin/dev dev
